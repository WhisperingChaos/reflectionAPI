#  SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_ROOT
#    Directory location where all resources required to define a container's
#    service set and executables needed to manage these resources are stored.
#  SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_BIN
#    Directory location of executables needed to manage service resources,
#    and service management requests.  Service resources refer to things
#    produced or offerred by a service while a manage request executes
#    processes to provide, for example, the container's service manifest and
#    or binding service variables.
#  SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_LIB
#    Directory location of scripting libraries that support the 
#    construction of service management processes located in 
#    SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_BIN
#  SERVICE_CATALOG
#    A directory whose directory contents define the list of services offered 
#    by a container.  Each offered service appears as a directory name.  
#
#    Each service includes the following subdirectories:
#    >  'resource'  Encapsulates all resource related meta data for its 
#       parent service.
#    >  'resoruce/variable/definitions: This directory encapsulates meta data
#       describing resource variable definitions.  A varaible definition consists
#       of name and its type.  An instance of a ResourceType
#       supplies the implementation for primative resource management 
#       methods like its construction, connection, and disconnection to
#       the resource.  These operations are defined and exposed by
#       the ResourceHandle type.  They are used by management operations, like bind,
#       to govern/coordinate the consumption/production of resources between
#       services.
#       A resource variable may implement more than one ResourceType, but once
#       its bound it must be completely disconnected before binding it with a 
#       different ResourceType.
#    >  'resource/variable/definition/consumed' Declares all external resource variables
#       needed to satisfy a service's requirements to produce its product (output recources).
#       Each consumed resource is represented by a unique variable name.
#    >  'resource/variable/definition/produced' Identifies all the resources generated by transforming
#       the resources consumed by the service.
#    >  'resource/variable/definitions/type'  Contains ResourceType definitions needed to instantiate 
#       consumed or produced recources.
#TODO: Start
#  > For a distributed management scheme incorporate the following:
#  'resource/variable/bound/consumed'? Represents consumed resources instantiated and bound.
#  'resource/variable/bound/produced' Represents produced resources instantiated and bound.
#TODO: End
